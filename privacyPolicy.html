After you sign in, a persistent cookie stays in your browser and will be read by CarrierUp.com when you return to one of our sites or a partner site that uses our services. Session cookies only last for as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).

                        Cookies and other ad technology such as beacons, pixels, and tags help us serve relevant ads to you more effectively.

We work with website analytics and advertising partners, including Google Display Network, Facebook, etc. to deliver CarrierUp.com advertisements on third party publisher websites - these partners may set cookies on your computer's web browser. These cookies allow our partners to recognize your computer so that the ad server can show you CarrierUp.com advertisements elsewhere on the Internet, and so that our analytics software can measure your engagement and interactions while using CarrierUp.com services. In this way, ad servers may compile anonymous, de-identified information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw our advertisements, whether or not you interacted with our advertisements, and actions performed on subsequent visits to CarrierUp.com websites and applications. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you, and it allows CarrierUp.com to optimize the performance of our advertising campaigns and the usability of our website. In other words, we use analytics data in concert with data about our online ads that have been shown using the Google Display Network, Facebook for Advertisers, or other online advertising networks. By doing so, we can understand how anonymous users interacted with our website after seeing our ads.
